# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description 

This webpage provides a brief introduction to the basic principles of coding. I was motivated to create this webpage because I have an interest in learning more about the skills required to work in the role as a full stack developer. So far Iâ€™ve learned the basic functions of HTML, CSS, Git, and Javascript
